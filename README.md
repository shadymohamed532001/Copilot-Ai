## Getting Started

The "ChatGPT" app is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide users with an interactive chat experience powered by OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. Here's an overview of the app's features and functionalitie
- Home Screen:
> Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a home screen that serves as the main entry point.
The home screen may contain introductory information, branding elements, and options for users to initiate a conversation or explore additional features.
- Chat Interface:
> The core functionality of the app revolves around a chat interface where users can engage in conversations with a virtual assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT model.
The chat interface typically consists of input fields for users to type messages and display areas to view both user messages and AI-generated responses.
Messages exchanged in the chat interface are displayed in real-time, allowing for a fluid and interactive conversation experience.
